AutoTrace
=========

AutoTrace is a utility for converting bitmap into vector graphics.

This is a (slightly) modified version of the 0.31 version, designed to be
included as part of the AutoTraceFilter AviSynth plugin.

As such, much of the stuff designed around reading images and writing files has
been stripped out.
