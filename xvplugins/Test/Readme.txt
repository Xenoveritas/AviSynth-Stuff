The font in this directory is usr_share's version of Clint Bellanger's "Boxy Bold" bitmap font, from:

http://opengameart.org/content/boxy-bold-font-0

The original is in boxy_bold_font_4_0.png.

This has been modified to be "fixed width" which involved shrinking some of the glyphs and rearranging them to be in ASCII order.

A future version of the plugin might support "variable width" fonts.
