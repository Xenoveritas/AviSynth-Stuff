AviSynth Stuff
==============

This is basically a collection of AviSynth scripts that I've written that may
prove useful to other people in the [Let's Play
subforum](http://forums.somethingawful.com/forumdisplay.php?forumid=191) on
Something Awful.

It may also prove useful to some other people. There's not a lot here right now.

`Timer.avsi`
------------

The `Timer.avsi` include that creates a timer. For an example of how to use it, 
see the `Timer Example.avs` script.

It creates a timer that counts up as the clip goes on. It's mainly useful for
running races, but may also be useful in instances where you want to display
how long something takes.

You could also just use the built-in `ShowTime` AviSynth function, but this can
be used to make something that looks somewhat nicer.

`LayerFadeIO.avsi`
------------------

A function for fading another layer on top of a clip. Useful if you want to
overlay information on top of a base clip for a portion of the clip.

`SNESEffect.avsi`
-----------------

Provides a pixelation effect, similar to the effect a ton of SNES games use.
