AviSynth Stuff
==============

This is basically a collection of AviSynth scripts that I've written that may
prove useful to other people in the [Let's Play
subforum](http://forums.somethingawful.com/forumdisplay.php?forumid=191) on
Something Awful.

It may also prove useful to some other people.

Right now, there's basically only one thing here, the `Timer.avsi` include that
creates a timer. For an example of how to use it, see the `Timer Example.avs`
script.

It creates a timer that counts up as the clip goes on. It's mainly useful for
running races, but may also be useful in instances where you want to display
how long something takes.

You could also just use the built-in `ShowTime` AviSynth function, but this can
be used to make something that looks somewhat nicer.
